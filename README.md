# Interactive editor

Drew Neil has made it the subject of one of his vimcasts:
[vimcasts #20: running Vim within IRB][], and Chad Perrin has written an
article about it on TechRepublic:
[Use interactive_editor with irb for an inside-out Ruby IDE][].
There's also an outdated blog post which predates the gem from 2009:
[Integrating vim and IRB][].

## Usage

    $ gem install interactive_editor

Put the following in your .irbrc:

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'interactive_editor'

Then, from within irb:

    $ irb                        # or ripl
    > vi                         # (use vi w/ temp file)
    > vi 'filename.rb'           # (open filename.rb in vi)
    > ed                         # (use EDITOR env variable)
    > [emacs|vim|mvim|nano|mate] # (other editors)

Bonus: editing of objects on the fly (inspired by _why's [object aorta][])

    $ irb
    > { 'chunky' => 'bacon' }.vi

To try it out without installing the gem:

    $ git clone git://github.com/jberkel/interactive_editor.git
    $ cd interactive_editor
    $ rake console

interactive_editor also works with the IRB alternatives [ripl][] and [pry][].
